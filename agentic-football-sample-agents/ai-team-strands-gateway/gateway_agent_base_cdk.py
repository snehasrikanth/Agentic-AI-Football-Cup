"""Gateway-aware agent factory for AI soccer position agents (CDK/npm-CLI flow).

Sibling of gateway_agent_base.py with the same public API, for deployments
made with the npm AgentCore CLI (`python deploy_all.py`). There the gateway
and its Lambda tools are declared in agentcore/agentcore.json
("tactical-tools") and created by the CDK app, which injects the gateway
endpoint into every runtime as AGENTCORE_GATEWAY_TACTICAL_TOOLS_URL — no
GATEWAY_URL env var is passed at deploy time.

deploy_all.py stages this file into each agent directory AS
gateway_agent_base.py, so src/main.py imports it unchanged. The original
gateway_agent_base.py remains the module staged by the legacy deploy-all.sh
flow. gateway_invoke_handler.py is flow-agnostic (it reads no environment
variables) and is shared by both flows.
