# AI Team (Strands + Memory) — Per-Position Soccer Agents with AgentCore Memory

Five AI agents that each control a single player in a 5v5 soccer match, built with
[Strands Agents SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) and
[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/) for
cross-tick history recall.

## What's Different from the Balanced Team?

Each agent uses `AgentCoreMemorySessionManager` (STM) to persist conversation history
across game ticks. This lets agents recall opponent movement patterns, previous
tactical decisions, and game flow from earlier in the match.

Key differences:
- A `team_memory` resource is declared in `agentcore/agentcore.json` and created
  by the same `agentcore deploy` that deploys the agents — no separate
  create-memory step
- The CDK stack grants every agent runtime access to the memory and injects its
  ID as the `MEMORY_TEAM_MEMORY_ID` environment variable
- `AgentCoreMemorySessionManager` wired into each Strands Agent
  (`memory_agent_base_cdk.py`, staged into each agent at deploy time)
- System prompts instruct agents to leverage recalled history

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- AWS CLI configured with valid credentials
- AgentCore CLI and CDK: `npm install -g @aws/agentcore aws-cdk`
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) — used by the AgentCore CLI to package Python dependencies
- AWS account with Bedrock model access (Nova Micro, Lite, and/or Pro)
- CDK bootstrap (one-time per account/region): `cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>`

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (PowerShell) — no WSL required.
No Python packages needed to deploy — `deploy_all.py` uses only the standard library.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy (memory + all 5 agents)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 python deploy_all.py
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = "us-east-1"
python deploy_all.py
```

The script checks prerequisites, writes the deploy target, bootstraps CDK if
needed, stages the shared `lib/` and `memory_agent_base_cdk.py` into each agent
directory, and runs `agentcore deploy --yes`. That single deploy creates the
`team_memory` resource, grants the runtimes access to it, and injects
`MEMORY_TEAM_MEMORY_ID` into every agent — nothing to export or configure.

### 2. Local test

```bash
python3 ai-gk/test_local.py
python3 ai-gk/test_local.py --llm  # needs AWS credentials
```

### 3. Teardown

```bash
python destroy_all.py            # remove all 5 agents
python destroy_all.py ai-gk      # remove one agent
```

The memory resource is kept; remove its entry from `agentcore/agentcore.json`
and redeploy (or delete the CloudFormation stack) to delete it.

## Legacy scripts

`deploy-all.sh` / `deploy-all-windows.ps1` (with `create_memory.py` and
`memory_agent_base.py`) are the previous deployment path and still work.
Note the two paths manage **separate resources**: the legacy flow creates a
memory named `AITeamMatchMemory` outside CloudFormation, while this flow
creates `team_memory` inside the stack. Running both against one account
leaves two memory resources and two sets of agent runtimes.
