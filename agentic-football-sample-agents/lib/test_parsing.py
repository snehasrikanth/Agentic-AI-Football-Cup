"""Local test for command parsing — no AWS, no network, no model call.

Run:  python3 lib/test_parsing.py

Covers the case that is easy to miss: a model that writes Python's `True` instead of
JSON's `true`. Before this was handled, every command carrying a boolean was silently
discarded and the agent fell back to rule-based play for the whole match. The other half
matters just as much — a string that merely CONTAINS the word "True" must survive
untouched, because rewriting the model's prose would be worse than dropping a command.
