# AI Team (Strands) — Extremely Defensive

Five AI agents that each control a single player in a 5v5 soccer match with an
**extremely defensive** play style. All players stay in their own half, prioritize
blocking and defending, and scoring attempts are minimal.

Built with [Strands Agents SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) and deployed to
[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/).

## Strategy

- **GK**: Deep goalkeeper — never leaves goal line, distributes safely
- **DEF**: Ultra-defensive sweeper — never crosses halfway, marks tightly
- **MID**: Defensive midfielder — extra defender, passes backwards only
- **FWD1**: Defensive forward — tracks back, marks opponents, rarely shoots
- **FWD2**: Defensive forward — same as FWD1, covers right flank
